# Developing a Boost Converter Simulation Model in Simulink
### Mentor: Prof. Dr. Adil Sarwar

- Focused on simulating different values of inductor and duty ratio for the boost converterâ€™s mode of operation.
- During simulation, waveforms were plotted to showcase both continuous and discontinuous modes of operation.
- The project aimed to understand and visualize the dynamic behavior of the boost converter under varying conditions.
